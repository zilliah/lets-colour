## About

This toy lets users colour one or multiple "pixel" at a time, using random colours or colours from a particular hue. It uses the [X-Colours](https://x-colors.herokuapp.com/) API, and is written in HTML/CSS/vanilla JS.

## TIL

This project was a quick project to practice using APIs.

## Improvements

The UI needs to improve to make this actually usable. I would also like to allow users to modify the "pixel" size, and to be able to save their art.
